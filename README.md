## Context
The entire content is not finished, and the page Tickets (billetter) does not have images, the divs are colored to showcase the location and placement of the content.
The plan in regards to tickets is to have an background image with some dynamic hover properties to imitate modern pages with regards to the modules.
The ticket page (Billetter.cshtml) is the only other page that is developed alongside the Index page (PC.cshtml).
The home page was intended to give the user an option to choose between PC and Mobile due the need of having 2 prototypes with 1 for big screens and 1 for small screens.
This seems redundant when creating a page that optimally changes its content and display based on the viewport or viewheight and viewport which is handled to a degree.
